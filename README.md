# termQuiz

termQuiz is a simple and efficient tool designed to make quizzing easier and more streamlined. It not only aids in conducting quizzes but also simplifies the process of creating quiz libraries.

## Features

- Easy selection of question libraries.
- Randomized question and answer order for each quiz.
- Customizable quiz settings, including the option to be quizzed multiple times on the same question and the choice between counting all attempts or only until all questions are answered correctly.
- Easy navigation through file directories to select quiz libraries.

## Usage

Compile and run the `termQuiz.java` file. Follow the prompts to select your quiz library and customize your quiz settings.

## Creating a Quiz Library

Quiz libraries are simple text files (no specific file extension required). Each line represents a question and answer pair, formatted as `Question|Answer`. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and are ignored, as are empty lines.
